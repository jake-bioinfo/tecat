Downstream dependencies

    This is a new release, so there are no downstream dependencies.

Package Purpose
TECAT (Telomere End Chromosome Assaying Tool) is designed for analyzing telomere lengths using 3rd generation sequencing data. Key features include:

    Telomere motif identification from reference genomes
    Pattern matching for telomere sequences
    Chromosome-specific telomere length calculation
    Visualization of telomere length distributions

Additional Notes

    All examples in documentation run in under 5 seconds
    Required external system dependencies:

        seqkit (https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/)
        minimap2 (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
        MEME Suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/)


    Large data files for examples and vignettes are stored in inst/extdata
    Functions using multiple cores default to single-core processing on CRAN checks

Special Thanks

    Package development supported by the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University
    Thanks to Kevin Coombes and Mark Oelkuct for their guidance and support

Version Notes
v0.1.0

    Initial CRAN submission
    Core functionality implemented

Please note:

    All function examples are wrapped in \donttest{} when they require external dependencies
    Package uses tempdir() for all file operations during tests
    Memory usage has been optimized for CRAN's requirements
