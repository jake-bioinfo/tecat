Title: Calculating Chromosome End Specific Telomere Lengths
Author: Jake Reed, Kevin R. Coombes, Pradyun Pulipaka
Maintainer: Jake Reed <hreed.ga@gmail.com>
Description: This application determines chromosome end specific 
	telomere lengths using basic pattern matching with 3rd 
	generation sequencing. Telomere end chromosome assaying
	tool (TECAT) takes a species reference which includes telomeres, 
	determines the most common telomere motifs, and then 
	computes the telomere length based on sample reads which 
	contain	telomeric repeats. Telomere length determination 
	then creates interactive visualizations to aid the analysis 
	of sequenced samples.
